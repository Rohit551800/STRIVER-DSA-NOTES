# 📘 Striver DSA Sheet – Personal Notes in Hinglish + English + Approach

Welcome to my handwritten notes repository based on the **Striver DSA Sheet**!  
These notes are made in **Hinglish + English** for students who prefer a simpler, more relatable way of understanding complex DSA concepts.

## 🧠 Why These Notes?

When I started my DSA journey, I found that most tutorials and resources were either too complex or completely in English. So I decided to make my own notes — written the way I understand things best:  
➡️ In **Hinglish (Hindi + English mix)**, with real explanations, simple terms, and no unnecessary theory.

These notes helped me stay consistent and revise fast during my practice on **LeetCode**, **GFG**, and while preparing for **coding interviews**.
